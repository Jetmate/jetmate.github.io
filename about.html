  <p>
    Although I know that the term 'code' is very vague, it perfectly describes what I love to do. As a sophomore in high school, I'm self-taught, and thus have had more time than usual to develop a passion for all things computer scienc-y. This also means that I have had more time to experiment with different languages and fields, such as game design and machine learning.

    But more than anything I love web development. I know everyone says this, but I don't hesitate to call myself a full-stack developer. On the client side, I've experimented with a lot of technologies, but right now I primarily use React. Although I love making overly complicated Javascript sites, I have an especially strong passion for great design. While interning at the fantastic Lebedev Studio in Moscow, I got the opportunity to work with arguably some of the best designers in the world, who helped me realize the power of a well-designed product.

    On the backend, I've worked with several server frameworks, mainly Node/Express and Flask. My past projects include a dating site which uses PSQL and an online game platform which uses websockets to deliver fast communication among clients.

    An overarching goal I have is to break the stigma surrounding CS. Especially at my school, coding is often looked down upon as being something that takes years to master, and so (willing) participation is very low. The easy fix for this is to prove how simple coding can be (I learned Python, my first language, in a week!), and so I've started several initiatives, such as a coding club, to try to do this. I also regularly attend Hackathons to connect with the community that does exist in my city.

    I'm always interested in meeting new developers to work with (seriously! Chicago has a surprisingly small amount), so please contact me if you have something I can work on, or if you just want to geek out over code things.

    My languages: Python, C++, Lua, ES16 (Coffeescript), HTML5/CSS3, bash
